## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While working on this project, I learned about analyzing the structure of the elements in a webpage and using CSS Grid to make the layout responsive. Instead of specifying margin and padding for every component to position it, I applied the Grid layout to the project for responsiveness.

### Continued development

In the future, I want to use Javascript to make my webpages more interactive and appealing. I also want to keep using `clamp()` for fluid typography. But I know I need to improve the code and make sure the webpage works well on all devices. I'll keep learning and following best practices to make great responsive designs.

### Useful resources

- [Accessibility Insights](https://accessibilityinsights.io) - This chrome extension helped me run automated checks to test the accessibility of the site.
